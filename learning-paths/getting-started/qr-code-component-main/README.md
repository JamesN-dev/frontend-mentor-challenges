## Process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Refreshed on some basic HTML and CSS concepts. Went with CSS Grid as it seems the most flexible and I wanted a refresher.

I translated the Figma design as much as possible. It wanted to use flex but I felt CSS Grid was the way to go here. 


### Continued development

I plan on continuing to use CSS Grid. Once I refresh myself on the CSS basics I'll start dabbling with SCSS and Tailwind again.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - CSS Grid Garden is a bunch of mini games using CSS Grid. Was a great way to refresh what i've forgotten about CSS Grid.
